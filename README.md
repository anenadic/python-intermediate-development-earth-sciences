# Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python

A two day, intermediate-level course in research software engineering and development skills and working as part of a 
team (using Python as an example language).

A typical learner for this course may be someone who has gained basic software development skills either by 
self-learning or attending a foundational course such as the novice [Software Carpentry Python course][swc-lessons]. 
However, their software 
development-related projects are now becoming larger and more complex and they need more 
intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code, 
automate the process of testing and verifying its correctness and support collaborations with others.

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software development 
process in a team, starting from an existing piece of software.

The software project template repository used for this lesson is available at:
<https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation>.

The lesson is using the official [Carpentries lesson template][styles].

### Lesson Status
The lesson is currently in beta - it has been tested several times with 
different cohorts by the lesson authors as well as independently by people not involved in the course development
and is in a good state to be reused and taught by others.

## Teaching the Lesson
If you would like to teach this lesson to your audience and help with more beta testing, 
please let the lesson developers know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pilot&template=lesson-pilot-issue-template.md&title=) with your workshop details and a 
label ![pilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/-pilot-brightgreen.svg).
