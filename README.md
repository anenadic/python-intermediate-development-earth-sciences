# Intermediate Research Software Development In Python

A two day, intermediate-level course in research software engineering and development skills and working as part of a team (using Python as an example language).

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software development process in a team,
starting from an existing piece of software.
It continues from the material covered in the novice-level [Software Carpentry lessons][swc-lessons] and follows the same principles,
as described in [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-practices].

The example used in this lesson also builds upon the example used in Software Carpentry's [Programming with Python][programming-with-python] lesson.

The rendered version of the lesson is available at:

The software template repository for this lesson is available at:
