# Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python

This is a multi-day, intermediate-level lesson/course in software development skills for researchers using
Python as a programming language. A typical learner for this course may be someone who is working in 
academic research 
and, needing to write some code, has gained basic software development skills either by 
self-learning or attending, e.g., a novice [Software Carpentry Python course][swc-lessons]. However, their software 
development-related projects are now becoming larger and more complex and they need more 
intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code, 
automate the process of testing and verifying its correctness and support collaborations with others.

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software development process in a team,
starting from an existing piece of software.
It continues from the material covered in the novice-level [Software Carpentry lessons][swc-lessons] 
and follows the same principles,
as described in [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-practices].

The code examples used in this lesson build upon the examples used in Software Carpentry's 
[Programming with Python][programming-with-python] lesson and work with the patients' inflammation dataset.

The software project template repository used for this lesson is available at:
<https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation>.

The lesson is using the official [Carpentries lesson template][styles].

### Lesson Status
The lesson is currently in the alpha status, which means that it is still being actively developed. 
However, all planned episodes have been written and finished, and the lesson has be tested several times with 
different cohorts and is in a good state to be reused
and tried by others. Please be aware that there may be some discrepancies and inconsistencies 
with language, images, screenshots and code outputs. We would appreciate any contributions from the community in 
fixing these issues - see the section below on how to make contributions. After these inconsistencies are fixed, 
the lesson will graduate to beta.
