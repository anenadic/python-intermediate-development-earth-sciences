## What is a Function?

Often when we use the term **function** we're referring to a construct for containing a block of code which performs a particular task.
But we borrowed the term from mathematics, so what does it mean there?

> In mathematics, a function is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set.
>
> -- Wikipedia - [Function (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics))

This definition is all about applying a transformation to some data - which gives us some other data as a result.
The Functional Programming paradigm is based on the mathematical definition of functions.
A program written in a functional style describes a series of operations which are performed on data to produce a desired output, the focus being on **what** rather than **how**.

You will likely encounter functional programming in the future in data analysis code, or if you use frameworks such as Hadoop, or languages like R.
In fact, there's a good [section on functional programming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html) in Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book.
In this book, Hadley gives a good summary of the style:

> Itâ€™s hard to describe exactly what a functional style is, but generally I think it means decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a function or combination of functions.
> When using a functional style, you strive to decompose components of the problem into isolated functions that operate independently.
> Each function taken by itself is simple and straightforward to understand; complexity is handled by composing functions in various ways.
>
> -- Hadley Wickham - [Functional Style](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html)

### Pure Functions and Side Effects

We define a **pure function** as one which satisfies two criteria:

1. The data returned must be the same each time the same arguments are provided
2. Calling the function has no **side effects**

Side effects cover any action that a function performs which affects anything other than the value they return.
Examples include: printing text, modifying the value of an argument, or changing the value of a global variable.

> > 3. `append_item_1` is not pure - the argument `a_list` gets modified as a side effect - try this yourself to prove it
> > 4. `append_item_2` is pure - the result is a new variable, so this time `a_list` doesn't get modified - again, try this yourself

There are a few benefits we get when working with a pure function:

- Testability
- Composability
- Parallelisability

**Testability**, as you might expect, means how easy it is to test the function - usually meaning unit tests.
It's much easier to test a function if we can be certain that a particular input will always produce the same output.
This has been the case with the examples we've seen so far.
If a function we're testing might have different results each time it runs, we need to come up with a new way to test it.
Similarly, it can be more difficult to test a function with side effects as it's not always obvious what the side effects will be, or how to measure them.

**Composability** refers to the ability to make a new function from a chain of other functions by piping the output of one as the input to the next.
If a function doesn't have side effects or non-deterministic behaviour, then all of its behaviour is reflected in the value it returns.
As a consequence of this, any chain of combined pure functions is itself pure, so we keep all these benefits when we're combining functions into a larger program.
As an example of this, we could make a function called `add_two`, using the `add_one` function we already have.

~~~
def add_two(x):
    return add_one(add_one(x))
~~~
{: .language-python}

Finally, **Parallelisability** - the ability for operations to be performed at the same time independently.
If we know that a function is fully pure and we've got a lot of data, we can often improve performance by distributing the computation across multiple processors.
The output of a pure function depends only on its input, so we'll get the right result regardless of when or where the code runs.

>
> Despite the benefits that pure functions can bring, we shouldn't be trying to use them everywhere.
> Any software we write needs to interact with the rest of the world somehow, which requires side effects.
> With pure functions you can't read any input, write any output, or interact with the rest of the world in any way, so we can't usually write useful software using just pure functions.

> ## Testing Impure Functions
>
> Try writing some unit tests for Python's [`random.normalvariate` [docs]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.normalvariate) or NumPy's [`numpy.random.normal` [docs]](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html) function.
> These functions both generate random numbers drawn from a normal distribution.
> Because they return a different result each time we call them, these functions are not pure.
>
> What is the correct behaviour for these functions?
> How can we test that?
> How reliable are the tests you've created?
>
> One possible approach you may have seen before when dealing with randomness is to set a known **seed** (a number which is used to kick off a random sequence) for the random number generator.
> This effectively makes the random number generator non-random, which allows us to test it more easily.
> By doing this we're almost turning it back into a pure function!
> Instead of using this approach here, try to come up with a method which tests the statistical properties of the generator.
> A seed-based approach will tell you if the generator is giving the correct result for that particular seed, but not whether it's behaving correctly in general terms.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > The correct behaviour of these functions is to generate random numbers from a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation.
> > So to test these functions, that's what we need to check.
> >
> > However, because we're dealing with randomness, we need to make sure we've got a sufficiently large sample for the tests to be reliable and pick a threshold that we're going to use to say that the sample is correct.
> > In this example solution, we've picked a sample size of one million, and testing that the expected measurements are correct to within two decimal places.
> > This does seem a little loose, but the stricter we make these criteria the more likely the test will randomly fail.
> > Even with these values, the test will occasionally fail if you run it enough times.

### MapReduce in Python - Comprehensions

Often, when working with data you'll find that you need to apply a transformation to each datapoint, and/or filter the data, before performing some aggregation across the whole dataset.
This process is often referred to as **MapReduce**, particularly when working within the context of **Big Data** using tools such as Spark or Hadoop.
The MapReduce style of data processing relies heavily on the composability and parallelisability that we get when using functional programming.
This name comes from applying or **mapping** an operation to each value, then performing a **reduction** operation which collects the data together to produce a single result.

In Python, we do have the built-in functions `map`, `filter`, but we'll skip over those and go straight to the recommended approach.
If you're particularly interested in this form of data processing, it might be worth looking up the documentation for these functions, but in general we use **comprehensions** instead.

~~~
integers = range(5)
double_ints = [2 * i for i in integers]

print(double_ints)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
~~~
{: .output}

The above example uses a **list comprehension** to double each number in a sequence.
Notice the similarity between the syntax for a list comprehension and a for loop - in effect, this is a for loop compressed into a single line.

We can also use list comprehensions to filter data, by adding the filter condition to the end.

~~~
double_even_ints = [2 * i for i in integers if i % 2 == 0]

print(double_even_ints)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[0, 4, 8]
~~~
{: .output}

Similarly, we have **set** and **dictionary comprehensions**, which look similar to list comprehensions, but use the **set literal** or **dictionary literal** syntax.

~~~
double_int_set = {2 * i for i in integers}

print(double_int_set)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
double_int_dict = {i: 2 * i for i in integers}

print(double_int_dict)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8}
~~~
{: .output}

These 'comprehensions' cover the map and filter components of MapReduce, but not the reduce component.
For that we either need to rely on a built in reduction operator, or use the `reduce` function with a custom reduction operator.

In many cases, what we want to do is to sum the values in a collection - for this we have the built in `sum` function:

~~~
l = [1, 2, 3]

print(sum(l))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

Otherwise, we'll probably need to write the reduction operator ourselves - but we need to cover another topic first.


> ## Generator Expressions
>
> There's one 'comprehension' left that we've not discussed - **generator expressions**.
> In Python, a **generator** is a type of **iterable** which we can take values from and loop over, but doesn't actually compute any of the values until we need them.
> Iterable is the generic term for anything we can loop or iterate over - lists, sets and dictionaries are all iterables.
>
> The `range` function is an example of a generator - if we created a `range(1000000000)`, but didn't iterate over it, we'd find that it takes almost no time to do.
> Creating a list containing a similar number of values would take much longer, and could be at risk of running out of memory and failing entirely.
>
> We can build our own generators using a generator expression.
> These look much like the comprehensions above, but act like a generator when we use them.

## Functions as First Class Objects

One of the important things that functional programming adds is the ability to pass functions around as if they were normal objects.
This is because in languages which support functional programming, functions are normal objects.

~~~
def add_one(num):
    return num + 1

def add_ones(in_list):
    return [add_one(x) for x in in_list]

result = add_ones([0, 1, 2])
print(result)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[1, 2, 3]
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
def add_one(num):
    return num + 1

def apply_fn(fn, in_list):
    return [fn(x) for x in in_list]

result = apply_fn(add_one, [0, 1, 2])
print(result)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[1, 2, 3]
~~~
{: .output}

In these examples above, we've used a list comprehension to effectively build the `map` function ourselves.
In Python 2, this is exactly how `map` worked - in Python 3 it's a little different as the `map` and `filter` functions are now generators.

For small functions which we only need in a single place, we can use a **lambda function** or **anonymous function** (so called because we don't give them names) instead.
These functions use the `lambda` keyword, take a number of arguments and contain a single expression as their body.
The value of this expression is then the return value of the lambda function.

~~~
def apply_fn(fn, in_list):
    return [fn(x) for x in in_list]

result = apply_fn(lambda x: x + 1, [0, 1, 2])
print(result)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[1, 2, 3]
~~~
{: .output}

The major distinction between lambda functions and 'normal' functions is that lambdas don't have a name.
We could give a name to a lambda function if we really wanted to - but at that point we should be using a 'normal' Python function instead.

~~~
# Don't do this
add_one = lambda x: x + 1

# Do this instead
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1
~~~
{: .language-python}

These are the fundamental components of the MapReduce style, and can be combined to perform much more complex data processing operations.

## Reducing MapReduce

Now we've got all the components we need to use MapReduce with reductions that aren't just `sum`.
Time to make our own reduction operators.

A reduction operator is a function which accepts two values to accumulate the values in the iterable.
One example would be to calculate the product of a sequence.

When we give this function to `reduce`, it first applies the function to the first two values in the iterable.
Then for each remaining value, we take the previous result and the new value as the new arguments to the reduction operator until we've processed all of the data.

~~~
from functools import reduce

l = [1, 2, 3]

def product(a, b):
    return a * b

print(reduce(product, l))
print(reduce((lambda a, b: a * b), l))
