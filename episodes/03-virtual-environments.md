## Introduction
So far we have checked out our software project from GitHub and inspected its contents and architecture a bit.
We now want to run our code to see what it does - we will do that from the command line shell 
(as we will for the rest of the workshop). We will also interact with Git from the shell. 
This 'forces' you to familiarise yourself and learn shell well - 
a bonus is that this knowledge is 
transferable to running code in other programming languages from within shell too and is independent from any IDE 
you may use in the future.

If you have a little peak into our code (e.g. do `cat inflammation/view.py` from the project root), you will see the 
following two lines somewhere at the top. 

~~~
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
~~~
{: .language-python}
 
This means that our code needs two *external libraries* (also called (third-party) packages or dependencies) - 
`numpy` and `matplotlib`. 
Python applications often use packages and modules that donâ€™t come as part of the standard Python distribution. This means
that you will have to use a *package manager* tool to install them on your system. Applications will also sometimes need a 
specific version of an external library, for example because the application may require that a particular 
bug has been fixed, or a specific version of Python interpreter. This means it may not be possible for one Python 
installation to meet the requirements of every application. The solution for this problem is to create a *virtual 
environment*, a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, 
plus a number of additional packages. 

Virtual environments are not just a feature of Python - all modern programming languages use them to isolate code 
of a specific project and make it easier to develop, run, test and share code with others. In this episode, we learn how 
to set up a virtual environment to develop our code and manage our external dependencies.

## Virtual Environments & Packages
So what exactly are virtual environments, and why use them?

A Python virtual environment is an **isolated working copy** of a specific version of
Python together with specific versions of a number of installed packages which allows you to work on a particular
project without worry of affecting other projects. In other words, it enables multiple side-by-side installations of
Python interpreters and different versions of the same third party package to coexist on your machine and only one to be selected
for each of your projects. As more dependencies are added to your Python project over time, you can add them to
this specific virtual environment and avoid a great deal of confusion by having separate (smaller) virtual environments 
for each project rather than one huge global environment with potential package version clashes. Another big motivator 
for using virtual environments is that they make sharing your code with others much easier (as we will see shortly).

Here are some other typical scenarios where the usage of virtual environments is highly recommended (almost unavoidable):
- You have an older project that only works under Python 2. You do not have the time to migrate the project to Python 3
or it may not even be possible as some of the third party dependencies are not available under Python 3. You have to
start another project under Python 3. The best way to do this on a single machine is to set up 2 separate Python virtual
environments.
- One of your Python 3 projects is locked to use a particular older version of a third party dependency. You cannot use the
latest version of the
dependency as it breaks things in your project. In a separate branch of your project, you want to try and fix problems
introduced by the new version of the dependency without affecting the working version of your project. You need to set up 
a separate virtual environment for your branch to 'isolate' your code while testing the new feature.

You do not have to worry too much about specific versions of packages that your project depends on most of the time.
Virtual environments enable you to always use the latest available version without specifying it explicitly.
They also enable you to use a specific older version of a package for your project, should you need to.

> Note that you will not have a separate Python or package installations for each of your projects - they will only
ever be installed once on your system but will be referenced from different virtual environments.

### Managing Python Virtual Environments

There are several commonly used command line tools for managing Python virtual environments:
- `venv`, available by default from the standard `Python` distribution (from `Python 3.3+`)
- `virtualenv`, needs to be installed separately but supports both `Python 2.7+` and `Python 3.3+`
- `pipenv`, created to fix certain shortcomings of `virtualenv`
- `conda` which comes together with the Anaconda Python distribution

While there are pros and cons for using each of the above, all will do the job of managing Python
virtual environments for you and it may be a matter of personal preference which one you go for.
For the purposes of this workshop, we will use `venv` to create and manage our 
virtual environment. The upside is that `venv` virtual environments created from the command line are 
recognised and picked up automatically by PyCharm IDE.

### Managing Python Packages

Package manager tool called `pip` is most commonly used to install, upgrade, and remove packages on your system. 
Pip interacts 
 and obtains the packages from the central repository called [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).
Pip can now be used with all Python distributions (including Anaconda).

> ## A Note on Anaconda and `conda`
> Anaconda is an open source Python
> distribution commonly used for scientific programming - it conveniently installs Python and a
> number of commonly used scientific computing packages so you do not have to obtain them separately. 
> `conda` (that comes with the Anaconda distribution) is a command line 
> tool with
> dual functionality - (1) it is a package manager that helps you find Python packages from 
> remote package repositories and install them on your system, and (2) it is also a virtual environment manager.
> So, if you are using Anaconda Python distribution, you can use `conda` for both tasks. 
>
{: .callout}

> ## Mixing `pip` and `conda`
> Sometimes packages that you need are not available via `conda`, in which case you will have to mix 
> the use of both `conda` and `pip` to manage your packages. Recent versions of `conda` have improved support 
> for interoperability between `conda` and `pip` and, while `pip` only installs Python packages from PyPI package 
> repository, conda can now install packages from [Anaconda Repository](https://repo.anaconda.com/) 
> and [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/), as well as 
> [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) by using `pip` in an active `conda` environment. You can now also search for 
> PyPI packages via [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/search) and filtering by package type.  
>
> The advice from the [Anaconda blog](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment) is: 
"*... when combining `conda` and `pip`, it is best to use an isolated `conda` environment. 
Only after `conda` has been used to install as many packages as possible should `pip` be used to install any remaining software.*"

### Many Tools for the Job

Things with installing and managing Python distributions, third party packages and virtual environments are, well,
complex. There is abundance of tools for each task, each with its advantages and disadvantages, and there are different 
ways to achieve the same effect (and even different ways to install the same tool!). 
Note that each Python distribution comes with its own version of 
`pip` - and if you have several Python versions installed you have to be extra careful to use the correct `pip` to 
manage external packages for that Python version.

`venv` and `pip` are now the *de facto* standards for virtual environment and package management for Python 3. 
However, advantages of using Anaconda and `conda` are that you get (most of the) packages needed for 
scientific code development included with the distribution. If you are only collaborating with others who are also using 
Anaconda, you may find that `conda` satisfies all your needs. It is good, however, to be aware of all these tools, 
and use them accordingly. As you become more familiar with them you will realise that equivalent tools work in a similar 
way even though the command syntax may be different (and that there are equivalent tools for other programming languages 
too to which your knowledge can be ported).

Let us have a look at how we can create and manage virtual environments from command line using `venv` and `pip`.

### Creating a `venv` Environment
Creating a virtual environment with `venv` is done by executing the following command:

~~~
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment    
~~~
{: .language-bash}

where `/path/to/new/virtual/environment` is a path to a directory where you want to place it. 
This will create the target directory for the virtual environment (and any parent directories that donâ€™t exist already), 
and also create directories inside it containing a copy/symlink of the Python interpreter binary used to create the 
environment, the standard Python library, its own independent set of installed Python packages isolated from other projects, 
and various other configuration and supporting files. 

For our project, let's create a virtual environment called `inflammation` off the project root:
~~~
$ python3 -m venv inflammation
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you list the contents of the newly created `inflammation` directory, you should see something like:

~~~  
$ ls -l inflammation 
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
total 56
-rw-r--r--   1 alex  staff    71 25 Jun 13:13 __init__.py
-rw-r--r--   1 alex  staff   264  8 Sep 17:06 __init__.pyc

drwxr-xr-x   2 alex  staff    64  9 Sep 11:11 include

-rw-r--r--   1 alex  staff  1057  8 Sep 17:06 views.pyc
~~~ 
{: .output}

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you need to activate it:

~~~
$ source inflammation/bin/activate
(inflammation) $ 
~~~ 
{: .language-bash}

Activating the virtual environment will change your shellâ€™s prompt to show what virtual environment 
you are currently using, and modify the environment so that running Python will get you that particular version 
of Python.

### Installing Packages in an Environment With `pip`

We have already noticed that our code depends on two *external libraries* - `numpy` and `matplotlib`. We now need
to install these dependencies into our virtual environment using `pip`.  

To install the latest version of a package with `pip` you use the `pip install` command and specify the packageâ€™s name, e.g.: 

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 install numpy 
(inflammation) $ pip3 install matplotlib
~~~
{: .language-bash}

or like this to install multiple packages at once for short:

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 install numpy matplotlib
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you run the `pip install` command on a package that is already installed, `pip` will notice this and do nothing. 

To install a specific version of a Python package give the package name followed by `==` and the version number, e.g. 
`pip3 install numpy==1.21.1`. To specify a minimum version of a Python package, you can 
do `pip3 install numpy>=1.20`. You can also upgrade a 
package to the latest version, e.g. `pip3 install --upgrade numpy`.

To display information about a particular installed package do:

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 show numpy    
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Name: numpy
Version: 1.21.2
Summary: NumPy is the fundamental package for array computing with Python.

~~~
{: .output}

To list all packages installed with `pip`:

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 list 
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Package         Version
--------------- -------
cycler          0.10.0
kiwisolver      1.3.2
matplotlib      3.4.3
numpy           1.21.2
Pillow          8.3.2
pip             21.1.3
pyparsing       2.4.7
python-dateutil 2.8.2
setuptools      57.0.0
six             1.16.0
~~~
{: .output}

To uninstall a package installed in the virtual environment do: `pip3 uninstall package-name`. 
You can also supply a list of packages to uninstall at the same time.

### Exporting/Importing an Environment With `pip`

You are collaborating on a project with a team so, naturally, you will want to share your environment with your 
collaborators. This is so that that they can easily 'clone' your software project with all of its dependencies and everyone 
can replicate and have equivalent virtual environments on their machines. `pip` has a handy way of exporting,
saving and sharing virtual environments. 

To export your active environment - use `pip freeze` command to 
produce a list of packages installed in the virtual environment. 
A common convention is to put this list in a `requirements.txt` file:

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt   
(inflammation) $ cat requirements.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
cycler==0.10.0
kiwisolver==1.3.2
matplotlib==3.4.3
numpy==1.21.2
Pillow==8.3.2
pyparsing==2.4.7
python-dateutil==2.8.2
six==1.16.0
~~~  
{: .output}


The first of the above commands will create a `requirements.txt` file in your current directory.
The `requirements.txt` file can then be committed to a version control system (e.g. Git) and 
get shipped as part of your software and shared with collaborators and/or users. They can then replicate your environment and 
install all the necessary packages from the project root as follows:

~~~
(inflammation) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As your project grows - you may need to update your environment for a variety of reasons. For example, one of your project's dependencies has
just released a new version (dependency version number update), you need an additional package for data analysis
(adding a new dependency) or you have found a better package and no longer need the older package (adding a new and
removing an old dependency). What you need to do in this case (apart from installing the new and removing the 
packages that are no longer needed from your environment) is update the contents of the `requirements.txt` file 
accordingly by re-issuing `pip freeze` command and propagate the updated `requirements.txt` file to your collaborators 
via your code sharing platform (e.g. GitHub).

## Running Scripts From the Command Line
Our environment has been set up and activated we are now ready to run our `inflammation-analysis.py` script 
from the command line. You should already be located in the root of the `python-intermediate-inflammation` directory. 
To run the script, type the following command:

~~~
(inflammation) $ python3 inflammation-analysis.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
usage: inflammation-analysis.py [-h] infiles [infiles ...]
inflammation-analysis.py: error: the following arguments are required: infiles
~~~
{: .output}

In the above command, we tell the command line shell two things:

1. to find a Python interpreter (in this case, the one that was configured via the virtual environment), and 
2. to use it to run our script `inflammation-analysis.py`, which resides in the current directory.

As we can see, the Python interpreter ran our script, which threw an error -
`inflammation-analysis.py: error: the following arguments are required: infiles`. It looks like the script expects 
an input file or a list of input files to process. Do not worry about this error for now - 
we will learn how to fix the errors and write tests to detect errors in 
the following episodes.
