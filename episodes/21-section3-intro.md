At this point, 
it becomes particularly important that you rethink the design of your software, including:

- **algorithm design**: what method are you going to use to solve the core problem?
- **software architecture**: what components will the software have and how will they interoperate?
- **system architecture**: what system components will this software have to interact with and how?
- **UI/UX (User Interface / User Experience)**: how will users interact with the software?
