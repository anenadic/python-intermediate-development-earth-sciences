## Introduction

So far in this course weâ€™ve focused on learning technical practices, tools 
and infrastructure that help the development of software in a team environment, but in an individual setting.
Despite developing tests to check our code - no one else from the team had a look at our code 
before we merged it into the main development stream. Software is often designed and built as part of a team, 
so in this episode we'll be looking at how to manage the process of team software development.

## Structured Code Review 

Code review (also know as peer code review or peer review)
is a software quality
assurance process where one or several people (different from the code's author) check the software by viewing
parts of its source code to e.g. detect bugs early, check for coding standards compliance and consistent code
design and implementation, identify code optimisation points, etc.
