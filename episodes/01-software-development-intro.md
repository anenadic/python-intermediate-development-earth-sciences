start: true
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "Why is splitting an application in smaller functional units (modules) good when designing software?"
- "What are programming interfaces in software design?"
- "What is Model-View-Controller design architecture?"
objectives:
- "Understand programming interfaces in software design"
- "Understand Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in software design"
- "Use git to obtain a working copy of our template software project"

keypoints:
- "Programming interfaces define how individual modules within a software application interact among themselves (as well as how the application itself interacts with its users as it is simply one big module containing smaller sub-modules)."
- "MVC is a software design architecture commonly used for developing software projects which divides the application into three interconnected modules: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (input/output and data manipulation)."
- "Template repository to be used throughout this workshop is an example of an MVC application that manipulates patientsâ€™ inflammation data and performs basic statistical analysis using Python."
