## Introduction

With FizzBuzz, we saw an example of where Object Oriented Programming works badly, so where does it work well?

This paradigm is useful when data is structured, often because it represents an entity which exists in the real world.
This entity has **attributes** which can be measured, and **behaviours** which it can perform.
An obvious example of an entity with attributes and behaviours is a person.

People have names, heights, weights, etc., all of which might be useful for software to know about in some context.
In the context of our clinical trial data system, we might be interested in all three of these, but also in their measurements of inflammation.

Let's continue to develop this system, using Object Oriented Programming to design a more complete model of our patients.

## Encapsulating Data

One of the main difficulties we encounter when building more complex software is how to structure our data.
So far, we've been processing data from a single source and with a simple tabular structure, but it would be useful to be able to combine data from a range of different sources and with more data than just an array of numbers.

~~~ python
data = np.array([[1., 2., 3.],
                 [4., 5., 6.]])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Using this data structure has the advantage of being able to use NumPy operations to process the data and Matplotlib to plot it, but often we need to have more structure than this.
For example, we may need to attach more information about the patients and store this alongside our measurements of inflammation.

We can do this using the Python data structures we're already familiar with, dictionaries and lists.
For instance, we could attach a name to each of our patients:

~~~ python
patients = [
    {
        'name': 'Alice',
        'data': [1., 2., 3.],
    },
    {
        'name': 'Bob',
        'data': [4., 5., 6.],
    },
]
~~~

### Classes in Python

Using nested dictionaries and lists should work for some of the simpler cases where we need to handle structured data, but they get quite difficult to manage once the structure becomes a bit more complex.
For this reason, in the Object Oriented paradigm, we use **classes** to help with this data structure.
A class is a **template** for a structured piece of data, so when we create some data using a class, we can be certain that it has the same structure each time.
In addition to representing a piece of structured data, a class can also provide a set of functions, or **methods**, which describe the **behaviours** of the data.

With our list of dictionaries we had in the example above, we have no real guarantee that each dictionary has the same structure, e.g. the same keys (`name` and `data`) unless we check it manually.
With a class, if an object is an **instance** of that class (i.e. it was made using that template), we know it will have the structure defined by that class.

Different programming languages make slightly different guarantees about how strictly the structure will match, but in object oriented programming this is one of the core ideas.

Let's start with a minimal example of a class representing our patients.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Patient:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.observations = []

alice = Patient('Alice')
print(alice.name)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
~~~
{: .output}

Here we've defined a class with one method: `__init__`.
This method is the **initialiser** method, which is responsible for setting up the initial values and structure of the data inside a new instance of the class - this is very similar to **constructors** in other languages, so the term is often used in Python too.
The `__init__` method is called every time we create a new instance of the class, as in `Patient('Alice')`.
The argument `self` refers to the instance on which we are calling the method and gets filled in automatically by Python - we don't need to provide a value for this when we call the method.

In our `Patient` initialiser method, we set their name to a value provided, and create a list of inflammation observations, which is currently empty.

You may not have realised, but you should already be familiar with some of the classes that come bundled as part of Python, for example:

~~~ python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {1: '1', 2: '2', 3: '3'}
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

print(type(my_list))
print(type(my_dict))
print(type(my_set))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'list'>
<class 'dict'>
<class 'set'>
~~~
{: .output}

Lists, dictionaries and sets are a slightly special type of class, but they behave in much the same way as a class we might define ourselves:

- They each hold some data (or **state**), as you will have seen before.
- They also provide some methods describing the behaviours of the data - what can the data do and what can we do to the data?

The behaviours we may have seen previously include:

- Lists can be appended to
- Lists can be indexed (we’ll get to this later)
- Lists can be sliced (we won’t get to this)
- Key-value pairs can be added to dictionaries
- The value at a key can be looked up in a dictionary
- The union of two sets can be found (the set of values present in any of the sets)
- The intersection of two sets can be found (the set of values present in all of the sets)

> ## Test Driven Development
>
> In yesterday's lesson we learnt how to create **unit tests** to make sure our code is behaving as we intended.
> **Test Driven Development** (TDD) is an extension of this.
> If we can define a set of tests for everything our code needs to do, then why not treat those tests as the specification.
>
> When doing Test Driven Development, we write our tests first and only write enough code to make the tests pass.
> We tend to do this at the level of individual features - define the feature, write the tests, write the code.
> The main advantages are:
>
> - It forces us to think about how our code will be used before we write it
> - It prevents us from doing work that we don't need to do, e.g. "I might need this later..."
>
> You may also see this process called **Red, Green, Refactor**: 'Red' for the failing tests, 'Green' for the code that makes them pass, then 'Refactor' (tidy up) the result.
>
> For the challenges from here on, try to first convert the specification into a unit test, then try writing the code to pass the test.

## Encapsulating Behaviour

Just like the standard Python datastructures, our classes can have behaviour associated with them.

To define the behaviour of a class we can add functions which operate on the data the class contains.
These functions are the member functions or methods.

Member functions are the same as normal functions (alternatively known as **free functions**), except that they live inside a class and have an extra first parameter `self`.
Using the name `self` isn't strictly necessary, but is a very strong convention - it's extremely rare to see any other name chosen.
When we call a method on an object, the value of `self` is automatically set to this object - hence the name.
As we saw with the `__init__` method previously, we don't need to explicitly provide a value for the `self` argument, this is done for us by Python.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Patient:
    """A patient in an inflammation study."""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.observations = []

    def add_observation(self, value, day=None):
        if day is None:
            try:
                day = self.observations[-1]['day'] + 1

            except IndexError:
                day = 0

        new_observation = {
            'day': day,
            'value': value,
        }

        self.observations.append(new_observation)
        return new_observation

alice = Patient('Alice')
print(alice)

observation = alice.add_observation(3)
print(observation)
print(alice.observations)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<__main__.Patient object at 0x7fd7e61b73d0>
{'day': 0, 'value': 3}
[{'day': 0, 'value': 3}]
~~~
{: .output}

Note also how we used `day=None` in the parameter list of the `add_observation` method, then initialise it if the value is indeed `None`.
This is one of the common ways to handle an optional argument in Python, so we'll see this pattern quite a lot in real projects.

> ## Class and Static Methods
>
> Sometimes, the function we're writing doesn't need access to any data belonging to a particular object.
> For these situations, we can instead use a **class method** or a **static method**.
> Class methods have access to the class that they're a part of, and can access data on that class - but do not belong to a specific instance of that class, whereas static methods have access to neither the class nor its instances.
>
> By convention, class methods use `cls` as their first argument instead of `self` - this is how we access the class and its data, just like `self` allows us to access the instance and its data.
> Static methods have neither `self` nor `cls` so the arguments look like a typical free function.
> These are the only common exceptions to using `self` for a method's first argument.
>
> Both of these method types are created using a **decorator** - for more information see the [classmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod) and [staticmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod) sections of the Python documentation.

### Dunder Methods

Why is the `__init__` method not called `init`?
There are a few special method names that we can use which Python will use to provide a few common behaviours, each of which begins and ends with a **d**ouble-**under**score, hence the name **dunder method**.

When writing your own Python classes, you'll almost always want to write an `__init__` method, but there are a few other common ones you might need sometimes. You may have noticed in the code above that the method `print(alice)` returned `<__main__.Patient object at 0x7fd7e61b73d0>`, which is the string represenation of the `alice` object. We 
may want the print statement to display the object's name instead. We can achieve this by overriding the `__str__` method of our class.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Patient:
    """A patient in an inflammation study."""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.observations = []

    def add_observation(self, value, day=None):
        if day is None:
            try:
                day = self.observations[-1]['day'] + 1

            except IndexError:
                day = 0


        new_observation = {
            'day': day,
            'value': value,
        }

        self.observations.append(new_observation)
        return new_observation

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


alice = Patient('Alice')
print(alice)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
~~~
{: .output}

These dunder methods are not usually called directly, but rather provide the implementation of some functionality we can use - we didn't call `alice.__str__()`, but it was called for us when we did `print(alice)`.
Some we see quite commonly are:

- `__str__` - converts an object into its string representation, used when you call `str(object)` or `print(object)`
- `__getitem__` - Accesses an object by key, this is how `list[x]` and `dict[x]` are implemented
- `__len__` - gets the length of an object when we use `len(object)` - usually the number of items it contains

There are many more described in the Python documentation, but it’s also worth experimenting with built in Python objects to see which methods provide which behaviour.
For a more complete list of these special methods, see the [Special Method Names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) section of the Python documentation.

## Properties

The final special type of method we'll introduce is a **property**.
Properties are methods which behave like data - when we want to access them, we don't need to use brackets to call the method manually.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Patient:
    ...

    @property
    def last_observation(self):
        return self.observations[-1]

alice = Patient('Alice')

alice.add_observation(3)
alice.add_observation(4)

obs = alice.last_observation
print(obs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{'day': 1, 'value': 4}
~~~
{: .output}

You may recognise the `@` syntax from our lesson on parameterising unit tests - `property` is another example of a **decorator**.
In this case the `property` decorator is taking the `last_observation` function and modifying its behaviour, so it can be accessed as if it were a normal attribute.
We won't be covering how to make our own decorators, but in the Functional Programming section next, we'll see some of the features which make them possible.

## Relationships Between Classes

We now have a language construct for grouping data and behaviour related to a single conceptual object.
The next step we need to take is to describe the relationships between the concepts in our code.

There are two fundamental types of relationship between objects which we need to be able to describe:

1. Ownership - x **has a** y - this is **composition**
2. Identity - x **is a** y - this is **inheritance**

### Composition

You should hopefully have come across the term **composition** already - in the novice Software Carpentry, we use composition of functions to reduce code duplication.
That time, we used a function which converted temperatures in Celsius to Kelvin as a **component** of another function which converted temperatures in Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

In the same way, in object oriented programming, we can make things components of other things.

We often use composition where we can say 'x *has a* y' - for example in our inflammation project, we might want to say that a doctor *has* patients or that a patient *has* observations.

In the case of our example, we're already saying that patients have observations, so we're already using composition here.
We're currently implementing an observation as a dictionary with a known set of keys though, so maybe we should make an `Observation` class as well.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Observation:
    def __init__(self, day, value):
        self.day = day
        self.value = value

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)

class Patient:
    """A patient in an inflammation study."""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.observations = []

    def add_observation(self, value, day=None):
        if day is None:
            try:
                day = self.observations[-1].day + 1

            except IndexError:
                day = 0

        new_observation = Observation(day, value)

        self.observations.append(new_observation)
        return new_observation

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


alice = Patient('Alice')
obs = alice.add_observation(3)

print(obs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
3
~~~
{: .output}

Now we're using a composition of two custom classes to describe the relationship between two types of entity in the system that we're modelling.

### Inheritance

The other type of relationship used in object oriented programming is **inheritance**.
Inheritance is about data and behaviour shared by classes, because they have some shared identity - 'x *is a* y'.
If class `Y` inherits from (*is a*) class `X`, we say that `X` is the **superclass** or **parent class** of `Y`, or `Y` is a **subclass** of `X`.

If we want to extend the previous example to also manage people who aren't patients we can add another class `Person`.
But `Person` will share some data and behaviour with `Patient` - in this case both have a name and show that name when you print them.
Since we expect all patients to be people (hopefully!), it makes sense to implement the behaviour in `Person` and then reuse it in `Patient`.

To write our class in Python, we used the `class` keyword, the name of the class, and then a block of the functions that belong to it.
If the class **inherits** from another class, we include the parent class name in brackets.

~~~ python
# file: inflammation/models.py

class Observation:
    def __init__(self, day, value):
        self.day = day
        self.value = value

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Patient(Person):
    """A patient in an inflammation study."""
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.observations = []

    def add_observation(self, value, day=None):
        if day is None:
            try:
                day = self.observations[-1].day + 1

            except IndexError:
                day = 0

        new_observation = Observation(day, value)

        self.observations.append(new_observation)
        return new_observation

alice = Patient('Alice')
print(alice)

obs = alice.add_observation(3)
print(obs)

bob = Person('Bob')
print(bob)

obs = bob.add_observation(4)
print(obs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
3
Bob
AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute 'add_observation'
~~~
{: .output}

As expected, an error is thrown because we cannot add an observation to `bob`, who is a Person but not a Patient.

We see in the example above that to say that a class inherits from another, we put the **parent class** (or **superclass**) in brackets after the name of the **subclass**.

There's something else we need to add as well - Python doesn't automatically call the `__init__` method on the parent class if we provide a new `__init__` for our subclass, so we'll need to call it ourselves.
This makes sure that everything that needs to be initialised on the parent class has been, before we need to use it.
If we don't define a new `__init__` method for our subclass, Python will look for one on the parent class and use it automatically.
This is true of all methods - if we call a method which doesn't exist directly on our class, Python will search for it among the parent classes.
The order in which it does this search is known as the **method resolution order** - a little more on this in the Multiple Inheritance callout below.

The line `super().__init__(name)` gets the parent class, then calls the `__init__` method, providing the `name` variable that `Person.__init__` requires.
This is quite a common pattern, particularly for `__init__` methods, where we need to make sure an object is initialised as a valid `X`, before we can initialise it as a valid `Y` - e.g. a valid `Person` must have a name, before we can properly initialise a `Patient` model with their inflammation data.

> ## Composition vs Inheritance
>
> When deciding how to implement a model of a particular system, you often have a choice of either composition or inheritance, where there is no obviously correct choice.
> For example, it's not obvious whether a photocopier *is a* printer and *is a* scanner, or *has a* printer and *has a* scanner.
>
> ~~~ python
> class Machine:
>     pass
>
> class Printer(Machine):
>     pass
>
> class Scanner(Machine):
>     pass
>
> class Copier(Printer, Scanner):
>     # Copier `is a` Printer and `is a` Scanner
>     pass
> ~~~

>     def __init__(self):
>         # Copier `has a` Printer and `has a` Scanner

> Both of these would be perfectly valid models and would work for most purposes.
> However, unless there's something about how you need to use the model which would benefit from using a model based on inheritance, it's usually recommended to opt for **composition over inheritance**.
> This is a common design principle in the object oriented paradigm and is worth remembering, as it's very common for people to overuse inheritance once they've been introduced to it.
>
> For much more detail on this (which will hopefully make more sense after we've covered software design a bit), see [this page](https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/composition-over-inheritance/) from a Python Design Patterns guide.

> ## Multiple Inheritance
>
> **Multiple Inheritance** is when a class inherits from more than one direct parent class.
> It exists in Python, but is often not present in other Object Oriented languages.
> Although this might seem useful, like in our inheritance-based model of the photocopier above, it's best to avoid it unless you're sure it's the right thing to do, due to the complexity of the inheritance heirarchy.
> Often using multiple inheritance is a sign you should instead be using composition - again like the photocopier model above.

> ## Building a Library
>
> Using what we've seen so far, implement two classes: `Book` (you can use the one from the earlier exercise) and `Library` which have the following behaviour:
>
> ~~~ python
> library = Library()
>
> library.add_book('My First Book', 'Alice')
> library.add_book('My Second Book', 'Alice')
> library.add_book('A Different Book', 'Bob')
>
> print(len(library))
>
> book = library[2]
> print(book)
>
> books = library.by_author('Alice')
> for book in books:
>     print(book)
>
> books = library.by_author('Carol')
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> 3
> A Different Book by Bob
> My First Book by Alice
> My Second Book by Alice

> The built in `set` class has a `set.union` method which takes two sets (one of which is `self`) and returns a new set containing all of the members of both sets, with no duplicates.
>
> Extend your library model with a `union` method which behaves the same way - it should return a new `Library` containing all the books of the two provided libraries.
>
> To do this you might need to create a `Book.__eq__` method.
> The `__eq__` dunder method should take two objects (one of which is `self`) and return `True` if the two objects should be considered equal - otherwise return `False`.
