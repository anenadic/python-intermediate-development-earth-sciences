## Encapsulating Data

### Classes in Python

### The `__init__` Method

Getting data in


## Encapsulating Behaviour

### Dunder Methods

> ## Class and Static Methods
>
> Would quite like to have a `Patient.from_record` classmethod if time
>
{: .callout}

> ## Decorators
>
> Might come back to these later in Functional Programming - if time
>
{: .callout}


## Relationships Between Classes

### Composition

Doctor *has* Patients

### Inheritance

Patient *is* a Person

Doctor *is* a Person

> ## Multiple Inheritance
>
> Exists in Python, doesn't in some other languages.
> Useful, but dangerous.
