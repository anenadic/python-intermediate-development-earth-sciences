## Setting the Scene
This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software development 
process in a team - we teach you to use a number of different software development tools simultaneously and 
interchangeably as you would in a real life rather than teaching each of them separately. 
After attending this workshop, you should be equipped with some intermediate Python development 
skills, as well as general skills on writing robust software collaboratively and releasing it for re-use by 
others.
