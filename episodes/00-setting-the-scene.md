## Introduction
So, you have gained basic software development skills either by self-learning or attending, e.g., a [novice Software 
Carpentry course][swc-lessons]. You have been applying those skills for a while now by writing code to help with your work and you 
feel comfortable developing code and troubleshooting problems to a certain extent. However, your software 
has now reached a point where thereâ€™s too much code to be kept in one script. It is perhaps involving more 
researchers (developers) and users, and more collaborative development effort is needed to add new functionality 
while ensuring previous development efforts remain functional and maintainable. At this point, 
it becomes particularly important that you rethink the design of your software, including:

- **algorithm design**: what method are you going to use to solve the core problem?
- **software architecture**: what components will the software have and how will they interoperate?
- **system architecture**: what system components will this software have to interact with and how?
- **UI/UX (User Interface / User Experience)**: how will users interact with the software?

This lesson teaches the above intermediate-level software development topics in a way that mimics a typical collaborative 
software development process. It will teach you to use a number of different **software development tools and techniques** 
simultaneously and interchangeably as you would use them in a real life. The material is organised into the following 
four bigger sections:

1. In the first section we are going to familiarise ourselves with using various tools and techniques for 
software development and a typical collaborative code development cycle: 
- **PyCharm** (an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool) for **code development, testing and debugging**, 
- **command line shell** for running code and interacting with **command line tool Git** for version control and 
branching the code out for developing new features in parallel
- **GitHub** (central and remote source code management platform supporting version control with Git) for code backup, sharing and 
collaborative development, 
- **virtual environments** to isolate our project from other projects developed on the same machine, and 
- **Python code style guide** to make sure our code is documented, readable and consistently formatted.
2. Once we know our way around different code development tools, in the second section we learn:
- how to set up a **test framework** and write tests to verify the correct behaviour of the code, 
- how to automate and scale testing with **Continuous Integration (CI)** using 
- **GitHub Actions** (a CI service available on GitHub) which enables testing on different target user platforms 
(combinations of operating systems and Python versions).
3. In the third section, we step away from writing code for a bit to look into different **software design paradigms** 
historically available to understand the wider landscape in which you can design software and to help you with the 
design decisions you have to make. Each paradigm represents a slightly different way of thinking about and structuring 
the code and each has certain strengths and weaknesses when used to solve particular types of problems - 
it is useful to know about the major paradigms so you can recognise where it might be useful to switch in your own code. 
4. Finally, in the forth section, we are back to practical applications and learning to **publish and release 
software for reuse** by others. You will work with your fellow learners on a group project (as you would do when 
collaborating on a software project in a team) and we will address best practices in **documenting**, **licencing**, **tracking 
issue**s, and **supporting your software**.

After attending this workshop, you will be equipped with skills and tools for intermediate software development in Python, 
as well as general skills on writing robust software collaboratively making it easier to use, develop, 
and sustain it in the future for yourself and others. Note that, while this material is Python-specific 
and we had to select a particular IDE to focus the material on (PyCharm), most of the skills taught here are transferable to other 
programming languages and IDEs. We list different options and ways of working whenever possible. Also check out the 
[wrap-up episode](../wrap-up/index.html)
for a comprehensive list of references to alternative tools and further reading. 

Diagram below depicts tools and techniques we will be using and learning throughout this workshop and gives a high-level overview 
of how they fit together.

> ## Prerequisite Knowledge
> This is an intermediate-level software development course intended for people who have already been developing code in 
> Python (or other languages), e.g. for at least a few months, and applying it to their own problems 
> after gaining basic software development skills. 
> So, it is expected for you to have some prerequisite knowledge on the topics covered, as outlined at the [beginning of the lesson](/index.html#prerequisites).
Check out this [quiz](../quiz/index.html) to help you test your prior knowledge and determine if this course is for you.

> ## Required Software
Please make sure that you have all the necessary software installed as described in the [Setup](../setup.html) section. 
This section also contains instructions on how to test your setup.

> ## Outdated Screenshots
> Throughout this lesson we will make use and show content from Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools (PyCharm and GitHub). 
> These are evolving tools and platforms, always adding new features and new visual elements. 
> Screenshots in the lesson may then become out-of-sync, refer or show content that no longer exists or is different to 
> what you see on your machine. If during the lesson you find screenshots that no longer match what you see or have 
> a big discrepancy with what you see, please open an issue describing what you see and how it differs from the lesson 
> content. Feel free to add as many screenshots as necessary to clarify the issue.
