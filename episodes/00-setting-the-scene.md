## Introduction
This lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical collaborative 
software development process. It will teach you to use a number of different software development tools and techniques 
simultaneously and interchangeably as you would in a real life, rather than teaching them separately. After 
attending this workshop, you will be equipped with skills and tools for intermediate Python software development, 
as well as general skills on writing robust software collaboratively making it easier to use, develop, 
and sustain it in the future for yourself and others.
           
> ## Prerequisite Knowledge
> This is an intermediate-level software development course intended for people who have already been developing code in 
> Python (or other languages), e.g. for at least a few months, and applying it to their own problems 
> after gaining basic software development skills. 
> So, it is expected for you to have some prerequisite knowledge on the topics covered, as outlined at the [beginning of the lesson](/index.html#prerequisites).
Check out this [quiz](../quiz/index.html) to help you test your prior knowledge and determine if this course is for you.

> ## Required Software
Please make sure that you have all the necessary software installed as described in the [Setup](../setup.html) section. 
This section also contains instructions on how to test your setup.
