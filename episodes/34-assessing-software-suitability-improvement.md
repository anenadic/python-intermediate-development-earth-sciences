What we've been looking at so enables us to adopt a more proactive and diligent attitude when developing our own software. But we should also adopt this attitude when selecting and making use of third-party software we wish to use. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and our software may inherit weaknesses in any dependent software or create other problems.


## Assessing software for suitability


> ## Conduct assessment on third-party software
>
> It is envisaged that a piece of software developed by another team will be adopted and used for the long term in a number of future projects. You have been tasked with conducting a detailed assessment of this software to determine its suitability, and will provide feedback to the developing team to fix these issues.
>
> Within your team:
>
> 1. Decide as a team how you will conduct the assessment
> 2. Conduct the assessment and register any issues you find on the other team's software repository
> 3. Be meticulous in your assessment and register as many issues as you can!
