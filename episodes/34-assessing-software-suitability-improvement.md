What we've been looking at so enables us to adopt a more proactive and diligent attitude when developing our own software. But we should also adopt this attitude when selecting and making use of third-party software we wish to use. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and our software may inherit weaknesses in any dependent software or create other problems.


> ## What makes good software good?
>
> In pairs, discuss what makes good code actually good and note these characteristics down.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > This exercise has been run with groups of researchers, from a diverse array of domains, all over the world by the Software Sustainability Institute seven times from 2011-2014. In summary, the most important characteristics were (against number of workshops where each is mentioned):
> > 
> > - 7: Well-designed, correct, and readable
> > - 6: Documented, unit tests
> > - 5: Usable, efficient
> > - 3: Under revision control, portable, robust, available
> > - 2: Follows best community practices, copyrighted and licensed, well commented, reuses other code where possible
> > 
> > How do these older results from over 6 years ago compare against our findings? How much have they changed in the intervening years? Probably not much!

## Assessing software for suitability



> ## Conduct assessment on third-party software
>
> It is envisaged that a piece of software developed by another team will be adopted and used for the long term in a number of future projects. You have been tasked with conducting a detailed assessment of this software to determine its suitability, and will provide feedback to the developing team to fix these issues.
>
> Within your team:
>
> 1. Decide as a team how you will conduct the assessment
> 2. Conduct the assessment and register any issues you find on the other team's software repository
> 3. Be meticulous in your assessment and register as many issues as you can!

> ## Supporting your software - how and how much?
> 
> Within your collaborations and projects, what should you do to support other users? Here are some key aspects to consider:
>
> - Provide contact information: so users know what to do and how to get in contact if they run into problems
> - Manage your support: an issue tracker - like the one in GitHub - is essential to track and manage issues
> - Manage expectations: let users know the level of support you offer, in terms of the when they can expect responses to queries, the scope of support (e.g. which platforms, types of releases, etc.), the types of support (e.g. bug resolution, helping develop tailored solutions), and expectations for support in the future (e.g. when project funding runs out)
> 
> All of this requires effort, and you can't do everything. It's therefore important to agree and be clear on how the software will be supported from the outset, whether it's within the context of a single laboratory, project, or other collaboration, or across an entire community.
