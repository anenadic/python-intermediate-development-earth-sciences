start: false
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What are virtual environments in software design and what are the advantages of using them?"
objectives:
- "Use pip to install Python packages"
- "Set up a virtual environment for a software project in Python"
- "Manage and share a virtual environment using `requirements.txt` file"

keypoints:
- "A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated spaces for them that contain per-project dependencies."
- "Instead of installing packages individually, pip allows you to declare all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file that can be easily shared with your collaborators."
- "Use `pip freeze` to take snapshot of your project's dependencies."
- "Use `pip -r requirements.txt` to replicate the virtual environment."
