start: false
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What are virtual environments in software design?"
- "What are the advantages of using virtual environments?"
- "How to set up a Python virtual environment?"
objectives:
- "Use `pip` to install Python packages"
- "Set up a virtual environment for a software project in Python using `venv`"
- "Manage and share a virtual environment using `requirements.txt` file"

keypoints:
- "A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated spaces for them that contain per-project dependencies."
- "Instead of installing packages individually, `pip` allows you to declare all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file that can be easily shared with your collaborators."
- "Use `pip freeze` to take snapshot of your project's dependencies."
- "Use `pip -r requirements.txt` to replicate a virtual environment on your machine."
