This unit of work is also often called a feature and the branch where you develop it is called a feature branch. Each feature branch should have its own meaningful name - indicating its purpose (e.g. “issue23-fix”). If we keep making changes and pushing them directly to main branch on GitHub, then anyone who downloads our software from there will get all of our work in progress - whether or not it’s ready to use! So, working on a separate branch for each feature you are adding is good for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - it enables the main branch to remain stable while you and the team explore and test the new code on a feature branch,\n",
    "    - it enables you to keep the untested and not-yet-functional feature branch code under version control and backed up,\n",
    "    - you and other team members may work on several features at the same time independently from one another,\n",
