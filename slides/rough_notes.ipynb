    "\n",
    "- _Fix_ this episode feels a bit out of place here\n",
    "  - the section starts with talking about tools and environment, and then quickly moves to talking about design without any warning, and then immediately back to tools and environment\n",
    "  - I think the problem is that there is no mention that there will be an introduction to the example project that will be used throughout the course; if there is some warning, then I think this would be fine, and the piece on architecture can probably stay where it is at the bottom of the page\n",
    "  - Also, the episode could do with a rename! It should be called \"Introduction to Our Project\" or something like that\n",
    "  - I have made these modifications in my `mbluteau-modifications` branch\n",
    "- Give an introduction to the \"patient inflammation project\"\n",
    "  - the software project studies inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis and reuses the inflammation dataset from the novice Software Carpentry Python lesson\n",
    "  - The dataset contains information for 60 patients, who had their inflammation levels recorded for 40 days, so a 2D dataset like below:\n",
    "  \n",
    "![](../fig/inflammation-dataset.svg)\n",
    " \n",

    "  - Complete the lesson \"Obtain the Software Project Locally\"\n",
    "  - please let us know when you are done by using a sticky note\n",
    "- Let's take a look at the project structure\n",
    "  - Demo this from commandline\n",
    "  - I like to use `tree`\n",
    "  - With this we see:\n",
    "  - README file (that typically describes the project, its usage, installation, authors and how to contribute),\n",
    "  - Python script inflammation-analysis.py provides the main entry point into the application\n",
    "  - three directories - inflammation, data and tests\n",
    "  - inflammation directory has two other Python scripts that we will look at more later\n",
    "  - data directory has the data we will be analysing in csv files\n",
    "  - tests directory has tests for our Python programs that we will be adding to and correcting\n",
    "  - **Important Point**: the structure of this project is not arbitrary\n",
    "    - a difference between novice and intermediate softare development is that at the intermediate level the structure of the project should be planned in advance, and this includes the structure of abstract entities like software components and how they interact\n",
    "    - in contrast, a novice will make this structure up as they go along (nothing wrong with that, it is part of learning, but at some point you need to stop doing that and have a think about these things in advance before you start a project).\n",
    "    - this is probably an appropriate point to link to the Python Cookiecutter project template: https://github.com/ukaea/scientific-python-cookiecutter\n",
    "- Complete exercise \"Have a Peak at the Data\". Please post your answers in shared document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Software architecture is the fundamental structure of a software system... It refers to a 'bigger picture' of a software system that describes high-level components (modules) of the system and how they interact.\"\n",
    "- Modules are an important idea\n",
    "  - common examples: libraries that we import and use in our own code (e.g. `numpy` and `matplotlib`), classes in object-oriented languages\n",
    "  - modules are largely self-contained (they can have dependencies) but there should be a well-defined way to interact with it (otherwise, what is the point?)\n",
    "  - the specification or contract of how to interact with a module is called a **programming interface** and these are everywhere in software engineering (e.g. user interfaces, APIs, and even function signatures)\n",
    "- Have a read of the Wikipedia articles about different architectures (5 minutes)\n",
    "- What were some common features? Are any subsets or special cases of others? Any practical differences?\n",
    "  - MVC (as presented in the course content, which is actually Model-View-Adapter) is sort of a subset of the multitier/layer architecture concept, where the view is the \"presentation layer\", the controller is the \"application/business layer\" and the model is the \"data layer\"\n",
    "  - client-server is another subcase of multilayer architecture (where the presentation and application layers have been merged on the client-side)\n",
    "  - in contrast, SOA takes a much more loosely coupled view of software components; good example is HTTP-based REST APIs\n",
    "    - there is an agreed communication protocol over a network that the services use to communicate\n",
    "    - the purpose and function of each of these services is much less prescriptive than MVC or multilayer\n",
    "  - There is clear differentiation on underlying hardware: MVC is implementation agnostic (could be on sigle device or multiple) while multitier and server-client require distinct machines communicating between each other; similarly for SOA\n",
    "- MVC is likely most applicable to research contexts and it is also what is used for the example project\n",
    "- Traditional MVC is actually a bit different from the course content:\n",
    "![](../fig/MVC-Process.svg)\n",
    "By RegisFrey - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10298177\n",
    "- There is direct communication between the model and the view, and the controller does not interact with the view\n",
    "- What is presented here is more accurately Model-View-Presenter/Mediator, where the view and model are completely decoupled and unaware of each other:\n",
    "![](../fig/mvc-DNA-guide-GUI.png)\n",
    "- TODO raise an issue about this on central repo?\n",
    "- For the example project, the MVC corresponds as follows:\n",
    "  - **Controller** = `inflammation-analysis.py` that performs basic statistical analysis over patient data and provides the main entry point into the application\n",
    "  - **View** = `inflammation/view.py` TODO add brief summary\n",
    "  - **Model** = `inflammation/model.py` TODO add brief summary\n",
    "- Discussion session (5 minutes) in small groups about how MVC might be applicable to their own work. Think of a piece of software you work on, and how this might be used for it. Or think of a new tool you might want to make that uses this.\n",
    "- Some final words on architecture and these particular patterns:\n",
    "  - don't get too caught up determining exactly what functionality should be the responsibility of each component\n",
    "  - the act of splitting things up and thinking about how they will interact through interfaces is where you get the most value\n",
    "  - it is likely you were already doing this in an informal fashion, but good to think about it more explicitly **and try to record your design in some appropriate format**\n",
    "  - TODO if there is no mention of how to store or record design information in a later section, raise an issue that some mention should be made about options"

    "  - in general, each project is going to have its own unique configuration and set of dependencies\n",

    "  - I think there are actually two scenarios here:\n",
    "  1. If you are providing a python application (i.e. building and deploying something) or doing a project that is a scientific analysis, then it is fine to pin your dependencies as detailed here in a `requirements.txt`\n",
    "  2. If you are providing a reusable library (i.e. one that might be called from someone else's code or another library) then pinning can be overly restrictive and cause issues for package managers, and it is considered bad practice to pin your dependencies like this\n",
    "    - Instead, you should specify loose dependency requirements in the `install_requires=[...]` metadata of `setup.py`. A full setup.py project is outside the scope of this course, but there are many good resources on this.\n",

    "    - <https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/>\n",
    "    - and if you want a template for Python projects that keeps `requirements.txt` and `install_requires` synced: <https://github.com/ukaea/scientific-python-cookiecutter>\n",
    "  - In general, I would recommend against pinning unless necessary\n",
    "- Get learners to practice exporting, then deleting their exising virtual env, the recreating it with the requirements.txt file\n",
    "- Live code the \"Running Python Scripts From Command Line\"\n",
    "  - confirm everyone gets the same error\n",
    "- TODO a note about environment management for other languages\n",
    "  - Ask John and Kristian about C++\n",

This unit of work is also often called a feature and the branch where you develop it is called a feature branch. Each feature branch should have its own meaningful name - indicating its purpose (e.g. “issue23-fix”). If we keep making changes and pushing them directly to main branch on GitHub, then anyone who downloads our software from there will get all of our work in progress - whether or not it’s ready to use! So, working on a separate branch for each feature you are adding is good for several reasons:\n",

In our area and science broadly, invariants tend to be some observable or experimental physical results, so if you test isn't based on that, you are probably going to have a tough time.\n",
