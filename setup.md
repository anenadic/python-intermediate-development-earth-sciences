Before we get started, there are a requirements we need to make sure we have installed.
You will need:

- The Anaconda Python distribution
  - Anaconda can be downloaded from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
  - We will be using the `conda` package manager
- Git - a popular version control tool
  - On Windows this can be downloaded from [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)
  - On macOS this is part of xcode-tools - just type `git` into your terminal and follow the instructions
  - On Linux Git can be installed using your favourite package manager
- A terminal / shell program such as Bash
  - On Windows the Bash shell will be installed as part of the Git distribution
  - On macOS and Linux you will already have a shell available
  - If you already have a shell other than Bash you can use that instead, none of the content of this lesson is specific to Bash
- PyCharm - a Python Integrated Development Environment
  - PyCharm can be downloaded from [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
  - The Community edition is fine, though if you are developing software for the purpose of academic research you may be eligible for a free license for the Professional edition which contains extra features
- A GitHub account - on online host for Git repositories
  - You can create an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one
