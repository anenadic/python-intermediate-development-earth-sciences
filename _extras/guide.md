## Course Design
The course follows a narrative around a software development team working on an existing software project that is analysing patients’ inflammation data (from the [novice Software Carpentry Python course](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons). A typical learner for the course is someone who has gained foundational software development skills in using Git, command line shell and Python (e.g. by attending prior courses or by self-learning). They are now joining the development team where they will require a number of software development tools and intermediate software development skills to engineer their code more properly taking into consideration the lifecycle of software, team ethic, writing software for stakeholders, and applying a process to understanding, designing, building, releasing, and maintaining software. 

The course has been separated into four sections which can be delivered in 4 half-day units: 

- Section 1: Setting up Collaborative Software Development Environment
- Section 2: Verifying Software Correctness at Scale
- Section 3: Developing Open Source and Inner Source Ready Code
- Section 4: Managing the Quality and Evolution of Software

## Course Delivery
The course is intended for self-learning - students are organised in small groups but work individually through the material and have a bunch of helpers on hand to help with any issues and questions. This provides a more comfortable and less intimidating learning environment with learners more willing to engage and chat with their group colleagues about what they are doing and ask for help. While this course can be live-coded by an instructor as well, we felt that intermediate-level learners would not require this and are capable of going through the material on their own at a reasonable speed. Exercises in later sections include team work where learners from the ame group are asked to collaborate on a software project (to provide more in-depth practice for software development in teams). 

Workshops can be delivered online or in-person with participants split into groups or breakout rooms from the outset - these groups are aided by helpers. 
A good ratio is 4-6 learners to 1 helper. If you have a smaller number of helpers than groups - helpers can roam around to make sure groups are making progress. 

The workshop kicks off with everyone together at the start of each day, where course leads provide session introduction and explain what the students will be learning on each day. After that, participants are split into groups and go through the materials for that day on their own with helpers are on hand to answer questions. At the end of each day, all reconvene for a joint Q&A session, feedback and wrap-up. In addition to the section intros on each day, there is a course introduction and motivation on the first day of the workshop to set the overall scene and expectations. 

## Helpers Roles and Responsibilities
At the workshop, everyone in the traning team is a helper. You may have more experienced helpers delivering introductions to the workshop and sections. Contact the course authors for intro slides you can reuse.

Roles and responsibilities of helpers include:
- Being familiar with the material
- Facilitating groups/breakout rooms and helping people going through the material
- Taking notes on what works well and what not - throughout the workshop - from your perspective and perspectives of students:
  - Collecting general feelings and comments
  - Your thoughts as potential student and instructor
- Noting mistakes, inconsistencies and learning obstacles in the materials
- Recording issues or doing PRs in the lesson repository during or after of the workshop
- Helping students get through the material but also being ready answer questions on applying the material in learners’ domains, if possible
